# Zepto-inventory-analysis
Overview of the project

This project is a learning-focused SQL analysis project created to strengthen my practical understanding of data analysis concepts using a real-world–style dataset. While working on this project, I actively explored multiple learning resources and platforms to understand best practices in data cleaning, exploration, and business-focused analysis.

The goal of this project is not only to derive insights from the data but also to learn by doing — applying theoretical concepts in a hands-on manner using MySQL. I am documenting and publishing this work as I learn, allowing me to reflect on my progress, solidify concepts, and continuously improve my analytical thinking.

By analyzing Zepto’s inventory data, this project demonstrates how structured SQL queries can be used to explore datasets, validate data quality, and extract meaningful business insights, even during the learning phase.
